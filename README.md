## Notes
If you want to change the function app code you can git clone the repo. Every time you change the FunctionApp code, be sure to repackage the FunctionApp.zip file. The zip file is what is referenced when the solution is deployed. The local .python_packages folder is necessary when deploying in this "push to deploy" manner. 

## Deploy the Solution
